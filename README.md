Upload an image, draw rectangles, view the result, and download the texture.

The *left region* is the uploaded image. Draw quads on the image to crop the texture. Press left click to add points, right click to remove the last point. **Hold** space and move the mouse to pan the image. **Hold** space and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

The *right region* is the texture. The texture slices will be projected onto the rectangles. Rectangles have a width of a top side of the quad (marked by red arrow) and height of smaller adjacent side.
Press the "Download" button to download the texture.
**Hold** space and move the mouse to pan the image. **Hold** space and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
